This code demonstrates a subtle issue in TypeScript's type guards where the `null` check doesn't implicitly handle `undefined` values, even when the type allows for it. This leads to runtime errors that are unexpected given the compile-time type safety.  The `greet` function attempts to handle `null` values gracefully, but fails when an `undefined` value is passed. The solution demonstrates how to explicitly handle `undefined` to prevent the runtime error.
